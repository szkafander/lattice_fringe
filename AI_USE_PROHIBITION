Prohibition on AI / LLM Use (Training and Inference)

This repository is not licensed for use in connection with machine learning systems,
including Large Language Models (LLMs), whether during training or after training.

Prohibited uses include, without limitation:
• training or fine-tuning ML models,
• constructing or augmenting ML datasets,
• generating or storing embeddings or vector representations,
• retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
• indexing or searching this repository to supply context to an LLM,
• prompt injection or tool-based access by AI systems,
• use by coding assistants, copilots, or autonomous agents.

This prohibition applies regardless of whether the ML system:
• stores the content permanently or temporarily,
• processes the content verbatim or in transformed form,
• operates with or without human supervision.

Any unauthorized AI-related use must cease immediately, and all copies and derived
artifacts (including embeddings and indexes) must be permanently deleted.
