# Matlab usage

- Make sure to add the "thirdparty" folder to the Matlab path.
- Open example.m. Change the "fn" variable so that it correctly points to the test image in the "data" folder.
- Run example.m.

The Matlab implementation uses:

- matGeom by David Legland (https://github.com/mattools/matGeom),
- histwc by Mehmet Suzen (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42493-generate-weighted-histogram).
